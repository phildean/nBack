# n-Back for MRI

12 Blocks; 30 Trials/block (10 Target); 4 Conditions (0-, 1-, 2-, 3-Back)

Stimuli are single digit numbers: [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]

ISI = 3s, Stimulus: 500ms

Stimuli Codes:

	0-Back Target       20 
	0-Back Non-Target   10
	1-Back Target       21
	1-Back Non-Target   11
	2-Back Target       22
	2-Back Non-Target   12
	3-Back Target       23
	3-Back Non-Target   13
	Pause               50
	End Of Block        60


_The n‐Back has four conditions (0‐, 1‐, 2‐, 3‐Back). 
The paradigm is a block design, with 12 blocks containing three randomly ordered repetitions of the four conditions. 
Task‐related blocks start with an information screen detailing the difficulty level of the upcoming block presented for 1–3 sec (jittered) 
and are alternated with 20s rest blocks (white crosshair in center of black screen). 
A feedback screen is presented after each block detailing participant's performance._
